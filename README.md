# Creating interactive charts in Python
In this project I use data available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420) and on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)#Reception) to explore HoloViz tools, specifically, Panel and hvPlot to create interactive charts and dashboards.

The final dashboard is deployed on [Heroku](http://pokeviz.herokuapp.com/Dashboard) and a guide to this project is available on [Medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/guide-to-creating-interactive-visualizations-in-python-78f79ffc7d61).
